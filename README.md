# Kaska - a handy way to keep your libraries at hand
I've been lately investigating [Lune](https://github.com/lune-org/lune), a standalone runtime for Luau. And then I had a thought, why not create an npm knockoff? I've looking through a couple of existing solutions: LuaRocks isn't designed for Luau and Lune and Aftman is more of a toolchain manager than a package manager. And so I had an idea of writing my own package manager based on the principles of how npm and aftman work.

I would be happy to see people help me with this, but for now I just occasionally work on this.

This project is too raw and I make this specifically for my personal needs until people get interested in it.


# Features I consider adding into Kaska
* Installable via Aftman
* Custom shell scripts
* Clone packages from GitHub
* Configure LSP to ignore modulesa
